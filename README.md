# Debian Package Debloater

This script removes some of the included software, games and utilites on Debian that I consider *mostly* useless. This script removes alot of packages but wont break your system.

## How do i run this script?

cd into the directory where the script is located

``` cd path/to/debloat.sh ```

run the script

``` sudo bash debloat.sh ```

After running, I'd recommend logging out and back in to finalize changes!
